module Drawing.Exercise where

-- Exercise 1: Implement a function 
-- colouredFTree :: Float -> Int -> Colour -> Line -> Picture 
-- that elaborates on fractalTree 
-- by accepting the colour of the tree as an additional argument.

-- Exercise 2: Vary colouredFTree by using the fade function, 
-- which we discussed in the context of spiral rays, 
-- to incrementally alter the colour in each recursive step.

-- Exercise 3: Vary colouredFTree further by implementing and 
-- using factor as demonstrated in the last screencast.
